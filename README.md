# Spiralbase‚Ñ¢
*The lagom forgetful storage structure*

**A temporal knowledge base built on forgetting, resonance, and spiral retrieval.**

Spiralbase‚Ñ¢ is not a traditional database. It is a rhythmic memory structure designed to remember what resonates ‚Äì and forget what fades. Inspired by biological decay, spiral time, and distributed intelligence, Spiralbase is part of the larger Mychainos‚Ñ¢ framework alongside Spirida‚Ñ¢.

## ‚ú® Core Concepts

* **Forgetfulness:** Data degrades unless recalled or reinforced. Memory is a living substrate.
* **Resonance-Based Retrieval:** Queries activate memory patterns that match temporally and semantically.
* **Spiral Time Model:** Past and present fold into each other ‚Äì retrieval is circular, not linear.
* **Biocomputation Interface:** Future versions may run on living substrates (e.g. fungal, DNA, sound).

## üìÅ Repository Structure

* `README.md` ‚Äì project overview and concept
* `PDF/spirida-spiralbase-v0.6.pdf` ‚Äì shared conceptual foundation with Spirida
* `appendix/` ‚Äì licensing documents (Creative Commons, GPLv3, CERN OHL v2, OpenMTA)
* `spiralbase-python/prototypes/` *(planned)* ‚Äì experimental Python or YAML models with decay + query examples

---

## üîÅ What Spiralbase Is (and Is Not)

* ‚úÖ A temporal, decaying, spiral-shaped memory field
* ‚úÖ An interface for regenerative interaction with knowledge
* ‚úÖ A prototype for living or soft technologies
* ‚ùå A permanent key-value store
* ‚ùå A static database meant for exact replication

---

## üî¨ Experimental Directions (Planned)

* `decay_layer.py` ‚Äì Simulate time-based memory degradation
* `resonance_query.py` ‚Äì Match queries to fading entries by echo strength
* `spiral_index.yaml` ‚Äì Represent content as patterns, not IDs

## üìú Licensing

Spiralbase‚Ñ¢ is released under a layered open license model:

* Conceptual layer: CC BY-SA 4.0
* Software prototypes: GPLv3
* Hardware (future): CERN OHL v2
* Biological interfaces: OpenMTA

See `PDF/spirida-spiralbase-v0.6.pdf` and Appendix A for details.

## üå± Quote

*‚ÄúWe do not need eternal databases. We need systems that remember what matters, and forget what doesn‚Äôt ‚Äì until the world returns to ask again.‚Äù*

## Appendix A: Licensing and Stewardship

> ‚ÄúWhat we seed in openness, we harvest in resilience.‚Äù

**Spirida‚Ñ¢ and Spiralbase‚Ñ¢** exist at the intersection of idea, implementation, and incarnation.  
To preserve their potential and prevent misuse, they require not a single license ‚Äî but a multi-layered commitment to openness, ethics, and long-term reciprocity.

### 1. Conceptual Layer ‚Äì Theory, Writings, Patterns

**License:** Creative Commons Attribution‚ÄìShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0)  
**Scope:** Philosophical foundations of Spirida‚Ñ¢, symbolic grammars and pattern libraries, educational diagrams, essays, and guides  
**Intent:** Allow free reuse, remix, and re-publication; preserve openness through share-alike conditions; ensure attribution to source thinkers and communities

### 2. Software Layer ‚Äì Tools, Compilers, Simulations

**License:** GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)  
**Scope:** Interpreters, compilers, development environments, Spirida‚Ñ¢ emulators, simulation sandboxes, custom logic engines and spiral pattern parsers  
**Intent:** Guarantee access to all source code; require open licensing for forks or adaptations; allow commercial use under cooperative terms

### 3. Hardware Layer ‚Äì Sensors, Interfaces, Devices

**License:** CERN Open Hardware License v2  
**Scope:** Sensor schematics and circuit blueprints, resonance devices and rhythm-aware chips, modular hardware for bio-digital interaction  
**Intent:** Mandate full design disclosure; enable community fabrication; prevent hardware enclosure or black-box design

### 4. Biological Layer ‚Äì Living Systems, DNA, Mycelium

**License:** Open Material Transfer Agreement (OpenMTA)  
**Scope:** Engineered fungal networks and root biointerfaces, DNA-based memory encoding structures, organisms adapted to spiral rhythm protocols  
**Intent:** Support open research and safe distribution; prevent bio-lockdown or privatization of life; require ethical collaboration and open science practice

### Scope of Interpretation and Future Technologies

This licensing structure includes not only current technologies, but also future or analogous systems such as:

- Successor DRM systems or secure enclaves  
- Quantum or chemical computing implementations  
- Biological/hybrid interfaces for Spirida structures  
- Closed or proprietary systems that replicate Spirida functionality  

**In all cases, principles of openness, non-extraction, stewardship, and co-creation prevail.**

### Unified Ethical Guardrails

- Spirida‚Ñ¢ may not be used for coercion, military, or surveillance purposes  
- It must not be patented, black-boxed, or stripped of ecological grounding  
- It must remain accessible, attributed, and shared with care

### License Declaration

This project is part of the Spirida Protocol, licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0, GPLv3, CERN OHL v2, and OpenMTA.  
By contributing or distributing, you affirm your commitment to ethical, ecological, and open development practices.

### Trademark and Stewardship

**Mychainos‚Ñ¢, Spirida‚Ñ¢, and Spiralbase‚Ñ¢** are unique constructs developed by Robin Langell and co-created with OpenAI‚Äôs language model.  
They may be registered trademarks. Regardless of legal status, they must be used with attribution and alignment with their ethical meaning.
