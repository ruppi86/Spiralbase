# Spiralbaseâ„¢ Composting Protocols

These protocols define the logic, rhythm, and ethical foundations for how Spiralbaseâ„¢ handles forgetting, transformation, and the conservation of relevance. Composting is not deletionâ€”it is metabolized memory.

## 1. Decay Cycle Fundamentals

### `decay_cycle_step()`

* Removes the oldest memory entry from the trace.
* Triggered by time, memory size, or a system-wide breath (tick).

### Principles:

* Oldest â‰  least valuable, but temporal distance increases compost readiness.
* A memory must be touched (accessed, echoed, resonated) to resist decay.

---

## 2. Memory Self-Assessment

Each memory entry may include introspective logic:

```python
def memory_self_assessment(self):
    if self.last_useful_activation > threshold:
        return "Ready to compost"
    elif self.connection_count < minimum:
        return "Becoming isolated"
    elif self.ossification_level > danger_zone:
        return "Becoming rigid"
    else:
        return "Still serving purpose"
```

## 3. Attention Budgeting

* Each memory carries a symbolic *attention signature*.
* A Spiralbase's total attention budget is finite.
* High-attention, low-resonance memories decay faster.

---

## 4. Resonance Thresholds

* Memories that echo across time and space strengthen via:

  * Reuse in queries
  * Co-occurrence with other strong symbols
* Lack of resonance signals readiness to decay

---

## 5. Sacred-but-Compostable Clause

* No memory is fully immune.
* Even sacred memories undergo periodic humility checks.
* Relevance is a living contract, not a divine right.

---

## 6. Manual Compost Trigger

Users (or higher-order systems) may:

* Mark memories for ritual composting
* Preserve emotional essence, but release technical detail

---

## 7. Compost Metadata

Each memory log may include:

* `compost_readiness_score`
* `decay_history`
* `last_resonance`
* `transformation_notes`

---

Spiralbase is a living soil. These protocols are seeds.
Let memory breathe.
