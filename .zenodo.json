  "description": "Spiralbase™ is a memory structure and conceptual knowledge base built around spirality, decay, and co-resonance. Rather than permanent storage, it uses time-decaying layers and non-linear retrieval paths. This repository contains early designs for content/time fusion structures, decay-based indexing, and glömska-inspired query protocols for epistemological resilience.",
